       "   'content': '<p>The first half of 2022 was nightmarish for the stock market, with fears of an imminent recession and supply chain disruptions working in the mind of investors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Tech stocks have invariably led the broader market in the past, be it a rally or a retreat, and this time was no exception. Despite fairly robust fundamental performances amid the trying backdrop, big techs came under significant selling pressure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Here&#39;s a look at how some of the high-profile tech stocks, commonly referred to using the acronym &quot;FAANG&quot; fared in the first half of the year:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The FAANG Stocks</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Meta Platforms, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ\">META</a>)<br />\\r\\n<strong>Amazon, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\">AMZN</a>)<br />\\r\\n<strong>Apple, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>)<br />\\r\\n<strong>Netflix, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ\">NFLX</a>)<br />\\r\\n<strong>Alphabet, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ\">GOOGL</a>) (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ\">GOOG</a>)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>No Winner Emerges: </strong> All the FAANG stocks incurred losses for the first half of the year, and more importantly, their losses were worse than the broader market. Apart from the market-wide pessimism, most were also left grappling with company-specific issues.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Meta: </strong> Meta, the parent of the flagship social media platform Facebook, is facing competitive pressure. China&#39;s Byte Dance-owned TikTok short video app has been giving its bigger rival a run for its money for some time now. Meta was left with no option but to&nbsp;launch its own version of the video clip format platform.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As Meta introduced Reels within Instagram and then on Facebook per se, it was forced to promote it at the expense of its highly-monetized segments such as Feeds and Stories.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meta&#39;s ad revenues continue to take a hit from Apple&#39;s app tracking transparency crackdown. The privacy changes reportedly will impact Meta&#39;s revenue by about $13 billion in 2022.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\" https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/04/26583422/chinas-covid-19-shutdown-is-beginning-to-bite-apple-says-analyst\"> China&#39;s COVID-19 Shutdown Is Beginning to Bite Apple, Says Analyst </a></em></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Amazon: </strong> For Amazon, it was the case of a tougher comparison against the pandemic years. The e-commerce giant benefited from the stay-at-home scenario that prevailed in 2020 and for much of 2021 when people splurged on online purchases.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/06/27563423/amazon-stock-begins-trading-on-split-adjusted-basis-what-investors-need-to-know\"> stock split the company implemented in June </a> did little to reverse the negative sentiment toward the stock.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Apple: </strong> Apple continued to deliver, persisted with its shareholder return policy, and kept on rolling out superior products and services.<br />\\r\\nThe company is heavily reliant on China for the production of its hardware products, and so when COVID struck in the country, investors began discounting production shortfalls. China is also a key market for Apple from the demand perspective.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Netflix: </strong> Netflix was the worst-performing FAANG stock in the first half. The company reported a massive loss of net subscriber adds in the first quarter, a function of competition and saturated penetration in its key markets. The company outlined a few fixes, including a crackdown on password sharing and launching an ad-supported service. Analysts, however, think any <a href=\" https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/22/04/26706979/how-long-will-it-take-for-netflix-to-set-its-house-in-order\"> recovery in the company&#39;s fundamentals could be a long-drawn-out process. </a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Alphabet: </strong> Google parent Alphabet&#39;s weakness is largely due to the industry-wide uncertainties that have the potential to impair its fundamentals.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img alt=\"faang_0.png\" src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/u101977/faang_0.png\" style=\"height:183px; width:340px\" /></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Other big tech stocks such as <strong>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMD#NASDAQ\">AMD</a>), <strong>Nvidia Corporation </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) and <strong>Microsoft Corporation </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\">MSFT</a>) also had a bad outing in the same period. These stocks shed 46.9%, 48.4% and 23.3%, respectively.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In comparison, the broader S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Indices were down 20.6% and 29.5%, respectively in the first half of the year.</p>\\r\\n',\n",
